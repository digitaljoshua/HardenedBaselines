# PI Data Archive Hardened Configuration Baseline

## About

**Note:** This documentation is currently in draft form. 

This document includes a generic hardening configuration to be applied to Windows Server core with a PI Data Archive application installed. The configuration is primarily intended for use with a Reference Cyber Security Data Sheet (CSDS) for use with the Technical Assessment Methodology (TAM) created by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). To effectively use a Reference CSDS, you must read the EPRI TAM and participate in a training workshop for the TAM.

This documentation assumes that the reader has a competent working knowledge of Microsoft Windows Server and the OSIsoft PI Data Archive. This documentation does not provide training on Windows Server or the PI Data Archive. Wherever possible, this documentation will reference official OSIsoft and Microsoft documentation.
